# choice-sets
Learning from humans when unsure of their options.

# generating alternatives
We know what the human chose. But how do we infer what options the human did not select?
 - Early stopping (lower magnitude inputs) - Rescale
 - Noise (less precise inputs) - Deformation
 - Holding inputs (fewer input changes) - Discretize: pick pair, move in direction longer than needed
We argue that its hard for the human to provide multiple, precise, large inputs.
